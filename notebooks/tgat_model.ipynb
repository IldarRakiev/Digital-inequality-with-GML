        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "We aim to explore the use of **Temporal Graph Attention Networks (TGAT)** for predicting changes in clusters of countries within the domain of digital inequality.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Objective:** Forecast how clusters of countries evolve over time based on historical data about digital access, usage, and other related indicators.\n",
        "- **Why TGAT:** TGAT is designed to handle **temporal graph data**, capturing both structural dependencies (edges between nodes) and temporal dynamics (how these relationships change over time). We will try to achieve better performance on this model in comparsion with other's models (baseline, GCN).\n",
        "- **Dataset:** The dataset consists of country-level indicators over multiple years, represented as a **dynamic graph** where nodes are countries, edges represent relationships between consecutive years, and node features encode digital inequality metrics.\n",
        "- **Challenge:** We want the model to predict **future cluster changes**, which requires capturing subtle temporal patterns in addition to structural information.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following sections, we attempt to implement and train a TGAT model to address this prediction task.\n",
